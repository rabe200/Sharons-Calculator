# Sharons-Calculator

Utilizing what i learn in Bootcamp @neueFische 

Currently a script generated grid with numbers and signs that get stored in an object that in the next step(s) will be iterated over and depending on which operators the iteration puts out, slices the object and add the calculations

maybe i got to change some more

current goal:

calculate what is put into the form-field by hitting the calculate button
